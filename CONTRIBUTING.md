These specs are written using [Bikeshed](http://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed).

Updates should be made to the Bikeshed files first and parsed into HTML using bikeshed command line tools or [CGI](https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/)

Please discuss issues and alternative syntax ideas in [Issues](https://github.com/berkmancenter/cache-link/issues)
